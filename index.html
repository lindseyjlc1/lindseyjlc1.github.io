			<p> </br><b>Hello!</b> My name is <b>Lindsey Lopez Cacho</b> and I am a first-year student at <b>Columbia University</b>.</br> <br>Educational disparities have affected neighborhoods across Los Angeles County, including my community in the San Fernando Valley. Schools in low-income areas tend to be underfunded, resulting in poorly equipped and impoverished conditions without the resources that students need for their academic success; this includes technology, textbooks, school supplies, and the proper training for teachers, counselors, and other staff members to work effectively with students. Ultimately, this has caused low educational outcomes for students such as lower grades, lower scores on standardized tests, and higher dropout rates compared to peers from wealthier communities.</br> <br>Due to these circumstances, I am driven to combat educational inequalities not only in Los Angeles County, but across the country as well.</br> </p>
